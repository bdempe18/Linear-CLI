# Linear CLI

## Way-too-brief install instructions

These are instructions for Ubuntu. Not sure where to put the build on mac. I need a better process here.

1. Download the repo
2. Navigation to the repo and run `go build -o linear`
3. Make sure the release is executable and move to `/usr/bin/local` or the Mac equivalent.
